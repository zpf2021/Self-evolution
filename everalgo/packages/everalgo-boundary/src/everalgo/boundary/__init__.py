"""Boundary detection — chat MemCell primitive.

Public surface:
- detect_boundaries — async function: split chat messages into MemCells
- DetectionResult    — ``(cells, tail, should_wait)`` NamedTuple returned by detect_boundaries

``WorkspaceMemCellExtractor`` (Jira / Email / Confluence) is NOT YET IMPLEMENTED and is
deliberately omitted from the public API — its methods raise ``NotImplementedError``. Import it
directly from ``everalgo.boundary.workspace`` if you need the reserved placeholder.

Facade classes (BoundaryDetector / AgentBoundaryDetector) live in everalgo-user-memory and
everalgo-agent-memory respectively; see Stage 3-4 of the refactor.
