"""Knowledge memory contract — flattened topic-tree node emitted by KnowledgeExtractor."""

class KnowledgeMemory(BaseModel):
    """A single topic-tree node from a parsed document, in flattened (DFS) form.

    Output unit of ``KnowledgeExtractor.aextract``. Each ``aextract`` call
    returns ``list[KnowledgeMemory]`` for one document; the first element
    (``topic_index=0``, ``depth=0``) is the document root node.

    Root node convention
    --------------------
    For every document the entry at ``topic_index=0`` is constructed
    programmatically (not LLM-extracted) and carries document-level
    context:

    * ``topic = document title`` — exempt from the ≤ 20 chars rule that
      applies to LLM-extracted section names.
    * ``summary = document-level summary``.
    * ``content`` is usually empty (container node).
    * ``parent_index = None``, ``depth = 0``.

    This places document-level signal directly inside the node list,
    so downstream cross-document operators do not require a separate
    ``doc_meta_lookup`` argument.

    Identity
    --------
    The composite key is ``(doc_id, topic_index)``.
