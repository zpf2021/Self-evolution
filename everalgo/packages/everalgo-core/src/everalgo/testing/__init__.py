"""Public testing helpers for EverAlgo — assertions + fake_llm.

Mirrors ``numpy.testing`` / ``torch.testing``: testing helpers live inside
``everalgo-core`` rather than as a separate distribution.

Public symbols (per AGENTS.md §7 step 6 + §9 + spec §3):

- ``FakeLLMClient`` — in-memory ``LLMClient`` Protocol implementation
- ``CallRecord``   — recorded chat() invocation type (for assertions)
- ``assert_episode_shape`` — Episode structural assertion helper
- ``assert_foresight_shape`` — Foresight structural assertion helper
- ``assert_atomic_fact_shape`` — AtomicFact structural assertion helper
- ``assert_profile_shape`` — Profile structural assertion helper
