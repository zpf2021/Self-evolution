"""Machine-readable skip / drop reasons for the agent-memory extractors.

:class:`~everalgo.agent_memory.AgentCaseExtractor` and
:class:`~everalgo.agent_memory.AgentSkillExtractor` reject their input at a dozen-plus distinct
gates. ``aextract`` reports every one of them the same way — an empty list plus a ``logger`` line —
so a caller staring at ``[]`` cannot tell a too-simple trajectory from an LLM-filtered one from a
malformed one. ``aextract_with_reason`` returns the same decisions as typed values instead, which is
what an upstream service needs to answer "why is this session's memory empty, and what do I do about
it?" without scraping logs.

The reasons here are **algorithmic**: each one names the gate that rejected the input and nothing
more. How a rejection should be attributed — caller mistake, not-yet-satisfied condition, platform
fault — depends on deployment context the library does not have, so that taxonomy belongs to the
caller. Likewise, ``detail`` carries the *numbers* behind a rejection (observed value, threshold) as
structured data rather than prose, so callers can compose their own user-facing message without
parsing strings.

Exceptions are not reasons. Provider failures (``LLMError``) and malformed LLM output
(``json.JSONDecodeError`` / ``ValueError``) still propagate — they mean the pipeline could not run,
not that the input was judged unworthy.

    A MemCell yields at most one case, so at most one of these applies per call. Members are
    ordered by the pipeline step that emits them.

    - ``EMPTY_MEMCELL`` — the MemCell carried no items at all.
    - ``NO_MESSAGES_AFTER_STRIP`` — nothing survived dropping the system head (everything before the
      first user message), i.e. the cell contained no user message.
    - ``NO_USER_MESSAGE`` — defensive only. The strip step returns either an empty list or a list
      whose first element *is* a user message, so this is unreachable from the extraction pipeline;
      it can only surface if the underlying pre-filter is called directly.
    - ``NO_ASSISTANT_MESSAGE`` — user turns only; the agent never responded.
    - ``TRAJECTORY_NOT_CLOSED`` — the last item is not a final assistant text response (it is a
      pending tool call, a tool result, or a user turn). This is the "cell must be closed" gate:
      a trajectory that stops mid-tool-loop is incomplete, not merely uninteresting.
      ``detail={"last_item_kind": ...}``.
    - ``NO_TOOL_SINGLE_USER`` — no tool calls anywhere and only one user message.
      ``detail={"user_count": ...}``.
    - ``NO_TOOL_TOO_FEW_MESSAGES`` — no tool calls and the conversation is too short.
      ``detail={"messages": ..., "min": ...}``.
    - ``NO_TOOL_ASSISTANT_TOO_SHORT`` — no tool calls and the assistant's combined output is too
      brief to hold a reusable lesson. ``detail={"tokens": ..., "min": ...}``.
    - ``TOO_FEW_TOOL_ROUNDS`` — fewer tool-call rounds than ``min_tool_call_rounds``. A round is one
      ``ToolCallRequest``; parallel calls inside a single request count once.
      ``detail={"rounds": ..., "min_rounds": ...}``.
    - ``TRAJECTORY_TOO_LARGE`` — still over the hard ceiling after heuristic trimming; the trajectory
      cannot be compressed into a prompt. ``detail={"tokens": ..., "limit": ...}``.
    - ``FILTER_REJECTED`` — the LLM filter found neither exploration nor user correction.
      ``detail={"llm_reason": ...}`` carries the model's own one-line rationale, which is free text
      and may change between runs — display it, do not branch on it.
    - ``COMPRESS_EMPTY_INTENT`` / ``COMPRESS_EMPTY_APPROACH`` — the compression call returned an
      empty required field, i.e. the LLM found nothing to say about the trajectory.

class SkillSkipReason(StrEnum):
    """Why a skill operation produced no :class:`AgentSkill`.

    Unlike the case path, one skill extraction handles a *set* of operations — the LLM sees one new
    case against N pre-filtered existing skills and may add, update, or leave alone each one. So
    these reasons attach per operation, except ``CASE_QUALITY_BELOW_THRESHOLD`` which short-circuits
    before any operation exists and is reported through
    :attr:`SkillExtractionResult.pre_reason` / :attr:`SkillExtractionResult.pre_detail` rather than
    through an :class:`OpOutcome`.

    - ``CASE_QUALITY_BELOW_THRESHOLD`` — the source case scored below ``skip_quality_threshold``;
      no LLM call was made. ``pre_detail={"quality": ..., "threshold": ...}`` — note this one lands on
      ``pre_detail``, not on an ``OpOutcome.detail``, because it fires before any operation exists.
    - ``OP_NOT_DICT`` — the LLM emitted a non-object entry in ``operations``.
    - ``OP_ACTION_NONE`` — the LLM explicitly decided this skill needs no change. Not a failure:
      a result of all-``OP_ACTION_NONE`` means the case carried nothing new.
    - ``OP_UNKNOWN_ACTION`` — action outside add / update / none. ``detail={"action": ...}``.
    - ``ADD_CONTENT_EMPTY`` — add operation with no content.
    - ``ADD_CONTENT_INSUFFICIENT`` — add operation whose content is too short or too few lines to be
      an actionable skill. ``detail={"lines": ..., "chars": ..., "min_lines": ..., "min_chars": ...}``.
    - ``ADD_NAME_AND_DESC_EMPTY`` — add operation with neither a name nor a description.
    - ``UPDATE_INDEX_INVALID`` — update operation whose ``index`` is not an integer.
      ``detail={"raw": ...}``.
    - ``UPDATE_INDEX_OUT_OF_RANGE`` — ``index`` does not address any supplied existing skill.
      ``detail={"index": ..., "size": ...}``. A frequent cause is the caller passing an
      ``existing_relevant_skills`` list that does not match what the prompt was rendered against.
    - ``UPDATE_DUPLICATE_INDEX`` — a second operation targeting an already-updated skill.
      ``detail={"index": ...}``.
    - ``UPDATE_CONTENT_INSUFFICIENT`` — replacement content fails the same sufficiency check as add.
      ``detail`` carries the same four keys as ``ADD_CONTENT_INSUFFICIENT``.
    - ``UPDATE_NO_FIELD_CHANGED`` — the operation would change nothing. ``detail={"index": ...}``
      names the existing skill the no-op targeted.
