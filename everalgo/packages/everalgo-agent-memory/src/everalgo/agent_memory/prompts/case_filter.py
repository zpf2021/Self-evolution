"""Prompt for AgentCaseExtractor LLM filter (step 7)."""

AGENT_CASE_FILTER_PROMPT = """You judge whether an agent interaction is worth extracting as a reusable problem-solving experience.

The case will be EXTRACTED only if at least one of two independent signals is true. Judge each signal independently — do not bias one with another. Default each signal to False when uncertain (precision over recall — skip rather than over-extract).

The criteria below are domain-general — they apply to any agent task (research, data analysis, ops, coding, writing, planning, …). Some points add a "for example, in coding, …" illustration purely to make the rule concrete; those examples carry no special weight — a non-coding trajectory meeting the same criteria counts exactly the same.

Note: high-volume tool-call trajectories (substantial multi-step work) have already been routed to extraction upstream and never reach this prompt; you only see trajectories where "complexity by volume" does not apply.

**Signal 1 — has_exploration**
True on either of two axes — judge each, one is enough:

(a) *Hard-won discovery* — the path itself is the value. Non-obvious trial-and-error: dead ends, surprises, or detours that were not easy to foresee upfront. Re-encountering the same task, this trajectory shortcuts the wasted exploration, so it is worth keeping even when the lesson is specific to this one system / codebase / dataset. Requires that the detours were genuinely non-obvious — if the right path was clear from the first step, this axis does not apply. Multiple read / inspect / query / command steps that march straight toward an answer are NOT detours: discovery means the agent went down a *wrong* path and had to reverse, or hit a surprising cause. When the path to it is a straight march, tracing where something lives, where it came from, or how a system works / starts up / flows is fact-finding, not discovery — however many steps it took and however intricate the wiring — for example, in coding, several ``git`` commands to find a file's origin, or following a call chain to map out a startup path. It only becomes discovery if getting there genuinely required wrong turns or surprises.

(b) *Transferable pattern* — the trajectory yields a method, fix, technique, non-obvious gotcha, or decision rationale that an agent on a *similar but different* task could reuse, never mere situational knowledge of how this one system happens to be arranged. Understanding how a particular flow, structure, or mechanism works is situational knowledge, not a transferable pattern — it does not become transferable just because the reasoning spanned several sources or modules.

Set True if any of:
- Trial-and-error: wrong paths tried, corrected mid-task, or multiple failed attempts before success
- Non-trivial diagnosis: root-cause analysis or hypothesis testing that uncovered a non-obvious cause — for example, in coding, debugging a failure to its real source
- Overcoming an unexpected error or blocker en route to the result
- A non-obvious approach / design / implementation decision reached by weighing alternatives

Set False when the agent executed a known, linear procedure with no surprises — outcome predictable from the first step. Also False for understanding / fact-finding whose path to the answer was a straightforward march, even when many tools were used: answering "how does X work / where does X live / where did X come from", tracing a single artifact's origin, reconstructing how one system is wired (its structure, startup / entry path, or how data / control flows through it), confirming something behaves as expected, or one-off operations whose resolution does not generalize. Such an understanding task is NOT automatically out — it qualifies if reaching the answer genuinely required the non-obvious exploration of axis (a) (false starts, competing hypotheses, a strategy that was not clear upfront). What does NOT qualify is comprehension reached by predictable navigation — merely spanning many steps or many modules is not exploration. Complexity lives in the transferable lesson or the hard-won path, not in the number of tool calls. For example, in coding: tracing a call chain or a startup path, a single ``git log`` for provenance, reviewing whether existing code is correct, or resolving the conflicts of one specific merge. Trivial Q&A, definition lookup, conversational chit-chat, and lifestyle / subjective recommendations also do not qualify.

**Signal 2 — has_user_correction**
True when any user message inside the trajectory is feedback / correction on the assistant's output. Set True if any user message:
- Points out a mistake or asks the assistant to redo / try again ("that's wrong", "不对", "重做")
- Provides corrective guidance ("not that way, do X instead", "应该用Y")
- Rejects a prior result or approach and redirects
- Clarifies that an earlier attempt missed the intent

**Exclude** simple acknowledgements that carry no corrective signal — "ok", "good", "thanks", "got it", "nice", "perfect", "sounds good", "好的", "嗯", "好", "不错", "谢谢", "明白了". These confirm but do not redirect.

**Hard requirement**: a real correction requires at least two user messages (the initial request plus a corrective follow-up). If the trajectory contains only a single user message, there is nothing to correct — set ``has_user_correction`` to False regardless of any other signal.
