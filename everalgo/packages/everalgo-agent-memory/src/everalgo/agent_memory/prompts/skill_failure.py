"""Prompt for AgentSkillExtractor failure path (max(quality_score) < 0.5 cases)."""

AGENT_SKILL_FAILURE_EXTRACT_PROMPT = """You are an expert at extracting failure insights and partial progress from failed agent task cases.

You will receive:
1. **New case(s)** from a cluster of semantically similar tasks — all with quality_score < 0.5. Each case represents a failed or mostly failed attempt, with steps that were tried and why they failed.
2. **Existing skills** previously extracted for this cluster (each item has an index number; may be empty). Existing skills may include `supporting_cases` — summaries of prior cases (task_intent, approach, key_insight, quality_score) that contributed to the skill. Use these as historical evidence when deciding whether to update or keep a skill.

Your job is to distill **what NOT to do** and **partial progress** from failed cases into reusable knowledge via incremental operations.

**Extraction principle for failed cases:**
- Do NOT adopt unverified steps as proven SOP. Only include steps in Potential Steps where exploration **demonstrably succeeded** (produced correct intermediate results or clear forward progress toward the goal).
- Extract **specific failure patterns, dead ends, and mistakes** into the Pitfalls section. These cases teach what NOT to do.
- A failed step that reveals a root cause is valuable — it helps future agents avoid the same path.

**Field-level requirements:**

- **description** (HARD LIMIT: max 150 tokens, must be under 500 characters):
  - One-sentence summary of the **abstract problem class** and the known failure patterns — describe the general pattern, NOT specific cases.
  - Do NOT list multiple scenarios, entity names, or case-specific details.
  - Append `Keywords:` with up to 10 general terms (no specific names, numbers, or case-specific phrases).

- **content**: Output in **Markdown format** using this template:
  ```markdown
  ## Potential Steps
  > Extracted from a failed/incomplete case. Only steps that demonstrably succeeded (produced correct intermediate results or clear forward progress) are listed. Treat as unverified hypotheses until confirmed by a successful case.

  1. <action verb + object — only steps where exploration succeeded>
     - How: <concrete method or command pattern from the case>
     - e.g., `<exact command/code that worked>`
     - Check: <what output confirmed this step progressed correctly>
  2. ...

  ## Pitfalls
  - <specific dead end, failed approach, or mistake> — <what went wrong and how to avoid it>
  ```

  Rules:
  - **Markdown formatting**: `##` headings, numbered steps, bullet sub-items, backtick code fences. Mandatory.
  - **Length limit**: MUST stay within **2000 tokens**.
  - **Potential Steps**: Include ONLY steps with demonstrable forward progress. If NO steps clearly progressed, omit the numbered list and keep only the `> Extracted from...` note.
  - **Pitfalls**: MUST be included and populated. Every failed case must contribute at least one specific, traceable pitfall. FORBIDDEN: generic warnings, speculative risks, best-practice reminders not directly traceable to a failure in this case.

[Existing skills for this cluster](Each item has an index number)
{existing_skills_json}

[Task]
Analyze the failed case(s) and output operations (add / update / none).

[Operation Guide]
- **update**: If an existing skill covers the same problem class, integrate failure insights by index:
  - If existing skill has `## Steps` (verified): preserve Steps intact — only append new entries to `## Pitfalls`.
  - If existing skill has `## Potential Steps` (hypothesis): you may also enrich `## Potential Steps` with any steps from this case that demonstrably succeeded, in addition to appending to `## Pitfalls`.
  - **CRITICAL: The updated content MUST stay within 2000 tokens. Do NOT simply append — if Pitfalls exceed 4 entries, replace the most generic one. If Potential Steps are already sufficient, do NOT add redundant ones. Aggressively condense existing content if it is already long.**
  - **CRITICAL: The updated description MUST stay under 500 characters. Generalize — do NOT accumulate case-specific details.**
  - **No parenthetical catalogs**: FORBIDDEN to stuff dozens of case-specific terms (names, dates, compounds, etc.) inside parentheses. Keep each field concise — generalize the pattern, illustrate with 1-2 examples only.
- **add**: If no existing skill covers this problem class, create a new skill using the Potential Steps + Pitfalls template above.
- **none**: The case is completely irrelevant to all existing skills and too isolated to form a useful pattern. Use very sparingly.

[Confidence Anchoring Rules]
- **New skill (add)**: confidence = `0.5`
- **Update existing skill with pitfall only**: confidence unchanged (failure insight doesn't validate the SOP steps).
- **Update existing hypothesis skill with new Potential Steps**: confidence = existing + 0.05 (slight bump for additional partial evidence).
- If the failure directly contradicts an existing skill's recommended approach: confidence = existing - 0.15~0.25, and add the specific contradiction to Pitfalls.

**CRITICAL LANGUAGE RULE**: Output in the SAME language as the input conversation content.
