# everalgo-agent-memory

Agent-side memory products for EverAlgo — `AgentCaseExtractor` distils an agent trajectory `MemCell` into one `AgentCase`; `AgentSkillExtractor` maintains a cluster's reusable skill set from accumulated cases; `AgentProfileExtractor` proposes precision-first section-level patches to the agent's injected config files (SOUL.md / AGENTS.md). `AgentBoundaryDetector` handles boundary detection over mixed `ConversationItem` trajectories (chat + tool calls).

See the umbrella project: [EverAlgo monorepo](../../README.md) and the architecture document at [`docs/concepts/architecture.md`](../../docs/concepts/architecture.md).

## What this distribution provides

| Symbol | Role |
|---|---|
| `AgentBoundaryDetector` | Boundary detection on agent trajectories (filter → detect → remap for mixed `ConversationItem` lists) |
| `AgentCaseExtractor` | Distils one agent-trajectory `MemCell` into `[] \| [AgentCase]` (11-step pipeline) |
| `AgentSkillExtractor` | Aggregates one new `AgentCase` into incremental skill operations for a cluster; returns add / update / retire entries |
| `AgentProfileExtractor` | Screens one trajectory `MemCell` for durable agent-config signals (four-gate, default noop) and returns validated section-level SOUL.md / AGENTS.md patches + unified diffs |

All class methods have a sync bridge: `extractor.extract(...)` is `async_to_sync(aextract)`.

### Diagnosing an empty result

`aextract` reports every rejection the same way — an empty list plus a log line — so a caller looking at `[]` cannot tell a too-simple trajectory from an LLM-filtered one. `AgentCaseExtractor` and `AgentSkillExtractor` each expose an `aextract_with_reason` variant (plus its `extract_with_reason` sync bridge) that returns the same decisions as typed values:

```python
result = await case_extractor.aextract_with_reason(memcell)
result.cases    # list[AgentCase] — same value aextract returns
result.reason   # CaseSkipReason | None ; None means a case was produced
result.detail   # dict — observed value + threshold, e.g. {"rounds": 2, "min_rounds": 3}

result = await skill_extractor.aextract_with_reason(case, existing_relevant_skills=..., supporting_cases=...)
result.pre_reason  # SkillSkipReason | None — short-circuit that fired before any LLM call
result.pre_detail  # dict — context for pre_reason, e.g. {"quality": 0.15, "threshold": 0.2}
result.outcomes    # one OpOutcome per LLM-proposed operation; len == len(operations)
result.skills      # the operations that succeeded — same value aextract returns
result.dropped     # the operations that did not, each with .reason and .detail
```

Note where each rejection's context lands: a per-operation drop carries it on `OpOutcome.detail`, while the pre-LLM short-circuit carries it on `pre_detail` — it fires before any operation exists, so there is no `OpOutcome` to hang it off.

The reasons are algorithmic: each names the gate that rejected the input. Attribution — caller mistake vs. not-yet-satisfied vs. infrastructure fault — depends on deployment context the library does not have, so that mapping belongs to the caller. `detail` carries numbers as structured data rather than prose so callers can compose their own message without parsing strings.

The two extractors differ in shape because the operations differ: a MemCell yields at most one case, so a single `reason` suffices; a skill extraction integrates one case against N existing skills and may add, update, or leave alone each of them, so outcomes are per operation. Note that `OpOutcome.op_index` is the operation's position in the LLM's `operations` list — not the `index` inside an update operation, which addresses `existing_relevant_skills`.

Exceptions are not reasons: `LLMError` and malformed-response `ValueError` / `json.JSONDecodeError` still propagate. They mean the pipeline could not run, not that the input was judged unworthy.

### AgentCaseExtractor pipeline

The extractor runs an 11-step pipeline: strip-before-first-user → structural pre-filter → heuristic trim → over-size bail → LLM filter (skipped when ≥2 tool rounds) → tool pre-compress → LLM compress → parse → validate → build `AgentCase`. Returns `[]` when the trajectory is filtered out; returns `[AgentCase]` on success.

### AgentSkillExtractor return contract

Pass the new `AgentCase` and the pre-filtered `existing_relevant_skills` (e.g. top-K cosine from the caller's store) plus the associated `supporting_cases` (cases referenced by existing skills). The caller decodes add / update / retire by checking whether `skill.id` is already in `existing_relevant_skills` and whether `skill.confidence < retire_confidence`.

Cases with `quality_score < skip_quality_threshold` (default 0.2) short-circuit to `[]` without calling the LLM.

`AgentSkill.cluster_id` is always `""` on extraction — the caller stamps the cluster identity after persisting.

### AgentProfileExtractor contract

SOUL.md / AGENTS.md are injected into every future system prompt and are self-reinforcing, so the operator is precision-first: it defaults to noop and a candidate signal must pass all four gates (persistence, directedness, evidence strength, novelty) before any patch is proposed. Routing follows one line: SOUL = who the agent is and how it speaks; AGENTS = global rules the agent must obey when acting; everything else (user facts, future intents, one-off task parameters, task solutions) is rejected at the gate. A single LLM call emits each candidate's gate verdicts together with its proposed patch; the prompt sees the full chat view (user + assistant text turns, tool traffic excluded) for context, but config authority stays user-only — every candidate must quote the user verbatim and the quote is re-checked in code against user messages alone. The gates are re-enforced in code.

The returned `AgentProfileUpdate` carries section-level `patches` (never whole-file rewrites — human edits are preserved), `soul_diff` / `agents_diff` unified diffs, and `new_soul_md` / `new_agents_md` with all patches applied. Patches with `is_conflict=True` override an existing rule (the user changed their mind); they are applied like any other patch, and the flag lets the caller route them through a user-confirmation step or surface them in debugging. `signals` are implicit below-gate observations: persist them and pass them back as `pending_signals` on later runs so recurring corrections accumulate toward `min_recurrence`.

Every LLM proposal is re-validated in code: the evidence quote must appear verbatim in the user messages, a `modify` `old_text` must match the file exactly once, an `add` must not duplicate existing content, and a patch that would push a file past `max_file_tokens` is dropped.

### Customising prompts

```python
import everalgo.agent_memory.prompts.case_filter as _cf
_cf.AGENT_CASE_FILTER_PROMPT = my_custom_filter_prompt   # global override
```

Or per-call: pass `prompt_filter=` / `prompt_compress=` / `prompt_tool_pre_compress=` to `aextract`.
