"""DFS flatten ``TopicClip`` tree into ``list[KnowledgeMemory]``.

Pure-compute stage that converts the internal intermediate tree into
the public output shape of ``KnowledgeExtractor.aextract``. The root
node lands at ``topic_index=0`` with ``depth=0`` per the
``KnowledgeMemory`` root convention; descendants follow DFS order with
``topic_index`` assigned in visit order.

``topic_path`` is built by joining each visited node's ``topic`` with
`` > `` from the root down. ``children_index`` is back-filled in a
second pass from ``parent_index`` pointers.

NOT exposed in the package ``__all__`` — internal to the knowledge extractor.
