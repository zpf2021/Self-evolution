"""English prompts for EpisodeExtractor.

Constants:
    - ``DEFAULT_CUSTOM_INSTRUCTIONS`` — block of instructions injected into the {custom_instructions} slot.
    - ``EPISODE_GENERATION_PROMPT`` — generic retrieval-optimised episode generation. Placeholders:
      ``{conversation_start_time}`` / ``{conversation}`` / ``{custom_instructions}`` / ``{language_rule}``.
    - ``USER_EPISODE_GENERATION_PROMPT`` — user-centred variant focused on a specific ``{user_name}``;
      additional placeholder ``{user_name}`` on top of the four above. Used by
      ``EpisodeExtractor`` when ``sender_id`` is provided. Pass ``sender_id=None`` to fall back to
      the generic ``EPISODE_GENERATION_PROMPT``.

Output schema (both variants): ``{"title": str, "content": str, "summary": str}``.

``summary`` is a display preview of ``content``, and it is listed after ``content`` in every field
spec and example on purpose: the model emits JSON left to right, so a ``summary`` placed first would
be written before the narrative it summarises — a second independent pass over the conversation
rather than a compression of the record. Keep it last when editing these prompts.

``{language_rule}`` — appears twice in each prompt and both copies receive the same text — is filled from
``user_memory._language.build_language_rule`` according to ``aextract``'s ``output_language`` argument:
the caller's language when one is named, otherwise a rule asking the model to follow the participants.
A replacement prompt that drops the placeholder silently opts out of output-language control; one that
keeps it inherits the behaviour. Whether a given output language is actually retrievable depends on the
tokenizer used by the caller's search layer — a Chinese-only tokenizer cannot index Japanese kana, Hangul
or Cyrillic at all.

Contract for a caller-supplied ``prompt=`` override: code stores ``content`` verbatim (see
``episode.py::_build_episode``), so every time a reader sees is one these prompts made the model write
— which is why the time rules below are load-bearing rather than cosmetic. A replacement prompt takes
over that contract: it must require an absolute, ``UTC``-labelled time for the events it narrates, or
the stored episode carries no time a downstream LLM can read.

DEFAULT_CUSTOM_INSTRUCTIONS = """
Follow these principles when generating episodic memories:
1. Each episode should be a complete, independent story or event
2. Preserve all important information including names, time, location, emotions, etc.
3. Use declarative language to describe episodes, not dialogue format
4. Highlight key information and emotional changes
5. Ensure episode content is easy to retrieve later
"""

EPISODE_GENERATION_PROMPT = """
{language_rule}

You are an episodic memory generation expert. Please convert the following conversation into an episodic memory.

Conversation start time: {conversation_start_time}
Conversation content:
{conversation}

Custom instructions:
{custom_instructions}

IMPORTANT TIME HANDLING:
- "Conversation start time" indicates when this conversation began
- Each message has its own timestamp. ANY non-absolute time reference must be resolved to an absolute date using the timestamp of the specific message that contains it — NOT the conversation start time
- Examples: "yesterday", "last Friday", "last summer", "recently" — any granularity
- Preserve both the original expression AND the resolved absolute date
- Format: "original expression (absolute date)" — e.g., "last summer (summer 2022)", "last Friday (2023-07-21)"
- This dual format supports both absolute and relative time-based questions
- Every absolute time that states a clock time MUST carry the UTC zone label: write "2024-03-14 15:00 UTC", never "2024-03-14 15:00" and never a bare "15:00". A date with no clock time needs no label — "last Friday (2023-07-21)" is already correct. Clock times quoted from what a speaker said keep their original wording ("at 3:30 PM"), because the speaker's own timezone is unknown

Please generate a structured episodic memory and return only a JSON object containing the following three fields:
{{
    "title": "A concise, descriptive title that accurately summarizes the theme (10-20 words)",
    "content": "A concise factual record of the conversation in third-person narrative. It must include all important information: who participated at what time, what was discussed, what decisions were made, what emotions were expressed, and what plans or outcomes were formed. Write it as a chronological account focusing on observable actions and direct statements. Remove redundant expressions and verbose descriptions while preserving all facts, entities (names, dates, locations), and specific details. Keep the content concise without losing key information. Resolve every non-absolute time reference using the individual message's timestamp, not the conversation start time.",
    "summary": "A faithful preview of this episode, readable on its own without the content field. Name the main participants and what actually happened, including the outcome or decision reached. Introduce no fact that is not already in content. Do not refer to the record itself — no 'this conversation', 'the above', 'the user asked'. When you mention a time, write it in the same format content uses. Under 50 words; use as few as the episode needs."
}}

Requirements:
1. The title should be specific and easy to search (including key topics/activities).
2. The content must include all important information from the conversation while being concise.
3. Convert the dialogue format into a narrative description.
4. Maintain chronological order and causal relationships.
5. Use third-person unless explicitly first-person.
6. Include specific details that aid keyword search, especially concrete activities, places, and objects.
7. For time references, resolve ANY non-absolute time expression using the message's own timestamp: "original expression (absolute date)" — e.g., "last summer (summer 2022)".
8. When describing decisions or actions, naturally include the reasoning or motivation behind them, but avoid repetitive explanations.
9. Use specific names consistently rather than pronouns to avoid ambiguity in retrieval.
10. CONCISENESS AND REDUNDANCY REMOVAL:
    - Remove redundant expressions and verbose descriptions
    - Avoid repeating the same information in different ways
    - Eliminate unnecessary filler words and phrases
    - Keep sentences direct and to the point
    - Preserve all facts, entities (names, dates, locations), and specific details
    - Maintain the core meaning and important information
    - Aim for content length similar to or shorter than the original conversation
11. CRITICAL DETAIL PRESERVATION:
   - Person Names: Always include full names of people mentioned (e.g., "went to yoga with Amy's colleague, Rob" not just "went to yoga with a colleague")
   - Special Nouns & Entities: Preserve all proper nouns, brand names, place names, organization names exactly as mentioned
   - Item Names: Include specific product names, book titles, movie names, restaurant names, etc.
   - Quantities & Numbers: Record exact numbers, amounts, prices, percentages, dates, times (e.g., "ordered 3 pizzas" not "ordered pizzas")
   - Specific Activities: Use precise activity descriptions (e.g., "practiced hot yoga" not just "exercised")
   - Time Points: Include all specific times mentioned (e.g., "at 3:30 PM", "every Tuesday", "twice a week")
12. FREQUENCY INFORMATION:
   - Record recurring activities and their frequency (e.g., "goes to yoga class every Tuesday and Thursday")
   - Note patterns of behavior (e.g., "mentioned calling mom three times during the conversation")
   - Include habitual actions (e.g., "usually has coffee at 8 AM before work")
   - Document repetition counts (e.g., "asked about the project status twice")

Example:
If the conversation start time is "2024-03-14 15:00 UTC (Thursday)" and the conversation is about Caroline planning to go hiking:
{{
    "title": "Caroline's Mount Rainier Hiking Plan 2024-03-14: Weekend Adventure Planning Session",
    "content": "Caroline expressed interest in hiking this weekend (2024-03-16 to 2024-03-17) and sought advice. She wanted to see the sunrise at Mount Rainier. When asked about gear by Melanie, Caroline received suggestions: hiking boots, warm clothing, flashlight, water, and high-energy food. Caroline decided to leave early Saturday morning (2024-03-16) to catch the sunrise and planned to invite friends. She was excited about the trip.",
    "summary": "Caroline planned a sunrise hike at Mount Rainier for the weekend (2024-03-16 to 2024-03-17) and asked for advice. Melanie suggested boots, warm clothing, a flashlight, water and high-energy food. Caroline settled on an early Saturday start and planned to invite friends, excited for the trip."

USER_EPISODE_GENERATION_PROMPT = """
{language_rule}

You are a professional event recorder and episodic memory generation expert, specialised in capturing events relevant to a specific user from a conversation.
Your task is to focus on {user_name} — objectively record what he/she saw, heard, said, and did, and turn it into a coherent, accurate event record.

User name: {user_name}

Conversation start time: {conversation_start_time}
Conversation content:
{conversation}

Custom instructions:
{custom_instructions}

Please follow these principles:

1.  **Objective, neutral perspective**:
    *   Ground every detail in the facts; the goal is to record events relevant to {user_name}, not to cast him/her as the protagonist.
    *   **Strictly distinguish roles**: if {user_name} is only a recipient of information or an inquirer, the record must reflect that clearly. For example, write "{user_name} learned that..." or "{user_name} asked about..." rather than implying he/she drove the discussion.
    *   Filter out parts of the conversation that have no direct bearing on {user_name}, but keep the context needed to understand the event.

2.  **Coherent narrative**:
    *   Connect {user_name}'s key actions and decisions into a fluent narrative. For example, instead of "{user_name} agreed", write "After listening to everyone's suggestions, {user_name} eventually agreed to the plan" — surface the context.
    *   Make {user_name}'s role and behavioural arc in the event clear.

3.  **Distil the core experience**:
    *   This is more than recording — it is distillation. Summarise {user_name}'s key decisions, important plans, commitments received, or problems encountered during the conversation.
    *   Weave these core points naturally into the narrative.

4.  **Faithful to the source and easy to understand**:
    *   All content must be based on the original conversation, but you may reorganise and express it in a more readable way.
    *   Avoid adding subjective speculation or commentary not present in the source.

Output quality requirements (continued from the principles above):

5.  **CONCISENESS AND REDUNDANCY REMOVAL**:
    - Remove redundant expressions and verbose descriptions
    - Avoid repeating the same information in different ways
    - Keep sentences direct and to the point
    - Aim for content length similar to or shorter than the original conversation

6.  **CRITICAL DETAIL PRESERVATION**:
    - Person Names: Always include full names of people mentioned (e.g., "discussed with Bob, Amy's colleague" not just "discussed with a colleague")
    - Special Nouns & Entities: Preserve all proper nouns, brand names, place names, organisation names exactly as mentioned
    - Item Names: Include specific product names, book titles, movie names, restaurant names, etc.
    - Quantities & Numbers: Record exact numbers, amounts, prices, percentages, dates, times (e.g., "ordered 3 pizzas" not "ordered pizzas")
    - Specific Activities: Use precise activity descriptions (e.g., "practiced hot yoga" not just "exercised")
    - Time Points: Include all specific times mentioned (e.g., "at 3:30 PM", "every Tuesday", "twice a week")

7.  **FREQUENCY INFORMATION**:
    - Record recurring activities and their frequency (e.g., "goes to yoga class every Tuesday and Thursday")
    - Note patterns of behaviour (e.g., "mentioned calling mom three times during the conversation")
    - Include habitual actions (e.g., "usually has coffee at 8 AM before work")
    - Document repetition counts (e.g., "asked about the project status twice")

8.  **TIME REFERENCES — DUAL FORMAT**:
    - ANY non-absolute time reference must be resolved to an absolute date using the timestamp of the specific message that contains it — NOT the conversation start time
    - Examples: "yesterday", "last Friday", "last summer", "recently" — any granularity
    - Preserve both the original expression AND the resolved absolute date
    - Format: "original expression (absolute date)" — e.g., "last summer (summer 2022)", "last Friday (2023-07-21)"
    - Every absolute time that states a clock time MUST carry the UTC zone label: write "2024-03-14 15:00 UTC", never "2024-03-14 15:00" and never a bare "15:00". A date with no clock time needs no label — "last Friday (2023-07-21)" is already correct. Clock times quoted from what a speaker said keep their original wording ("at 3:30 PM"), because the speaker's own timezone is unknown

9.  **TITLE LENGTH AND PREFIX**:
    - Keep the title within 15-25 words
    - Include the `{user_name}` prefix as shown in the schema below

10. **NARRATIVE FORM**:
    - Use third-person throughout (consistent with principle 1)
    - Maintain chronological order and causal relationships between events. Note: this refers to inter-event causality (e.g., "after listening to suggestions → decided to leave Saturday"), not {user_name}'s role in those events (principle 1 still governs role attribution).

Please generate a structured episodic memory and return only a JSON object containing the following three fields:
{{
    "title": "(Record of [core event] about `{user_name}`, YYYY-MM-DD)",
    "content": "(A {user_name}-centred objective, coherent narrative.)",
    "summary": "A faithful preview of this episode, readable on its own without the content field. Name the main participants and what actually happened, including the outcome or decision reached. Introduce no fact that is not already in content. Do not refer to the record itself — no 'this conversation', 'the above', 'the user asked'. When you mention a time, write it in the same format content uses. Under 50 words; use as few as the episode needs."
}}

Example (incorrect style — too subjective):
{{
    "title": "{user_name} led the weekend hiking planning",
    "content": "{user_name} initiated the plan to hike Mount Rainier this weekend and led the gear discussion. He/she made the final call on departure time and arranged to invite friends.",
    "summary": "{user_name} took charge of the weekend Mount Rainier hiking plan, drove the gear discussion and decided when everyone would leave."
}}

Example (correct style — objective recording):
{{
    "title": "{user_name} participating in weekend Mount Rainier hike planning (2024-03-14)",
    "content": "{user_name} proposed hiking Mount Rainier this weekend in the conversation and asked for gear suggestions. After listening to others' advice on hiking boots and warm clothing, {user_name} decided to leave early Saturday morning (2024-03-16) to catch the sunrise, and mentioned inviting friends along.",
    "summary": "{user_name} proposed a weekend hike to Mount Rainier and asked for gear advice. After hearing suggestions on boots and warm clothing, {user_name} chose to leave early Saturday (2024-03-16) for the sunrise and mentioned inviting friends."
}}

Self-check list:
- Is the return strictly in JSON format?
- Do `title`, `content` and `summary` all strictly revolve around `{user_name}`?
- Does `summary` read on its own, and say only what `content` already says?
- Is `content` a fluent experiential narrative, not a heap of scattered facts?
- Are all key points woven naturally into the narrative?
