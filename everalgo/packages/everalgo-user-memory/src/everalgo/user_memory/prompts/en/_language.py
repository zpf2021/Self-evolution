"""The output-language rules every extraction prompt in this package splices in.

A prompt receives ``CALLER_CHOSEN_LANGUAGE_RULE`` when the caller named a language, and otherwise the
fallback its own operator picks: the participant rule for the operators reading a raw conversation, and a
rule of its own for each operator whose input is already-extracted memory text — those inherit a language
rather than judge one, and each names the specific input it inherits from. Two of the texts below,
``CALLER_CHOSEN_LANGUAGE_RULE`` and ``PARTICIPANT_LANGUAGE_RULE``, were selected by measurement rather than
judgement: eight arms over the same 0.3.2 episode prompt body, 1750 calls each across five models and
thirty-five conversations, differing only in this block. The inheriting rules were not measured — they
predate the argument and are carried over verbatim from the prompts that already used them.

Every rule here is spliced in twice, at the prompt's head and tail, so none of them may refer to its own
position in the prompt — a sentence pointing above or below is wrong at one of the two ends.

``CALLER_CHOSEN_LANGUAGE_RULE`` names the language outright and leaves the model nothing to decide. Zero
drift over 1400 samples spanning seven languages, every interference pattern in the corpus, and all five
models — no scenario, no model, and no language deviated.

``PARTICIPANT_LANGUAGE_RULE`` asks the model to work the language out. That costs roughly one wrong
language in thirteen, and no rewriting closed the gap: five wordings and one structural variant all landed
between 10% and 26%, each fixing some scenarios while breaking others, because the underlying cause is not
the wording. Chinese characters anywhere in the input pull the output towards Chinese — inside a user ID,
inside a pasted paragraph, inside a single term in an otherwise English sentence — while English inside a
Chinese conversation does not pull back. Six mirrored scenario pairs across eight arms showed no exception.
The residual failures therefore skew one way: a conversation that should yield English is the one at risk.

This rule is nonetheless the best of the self-judging variants, and the only one that never drifted on
plain single-language conversations, which is why it is the fallback rather than one of the others.

The measurements behind those two texts are recorded internally; the corpus and runner live outside the
repository because they need real models and five-figure call counts.

INIT is the only call that chooses a profile's language rather than inheriting it, and the two paths that
inherit it bind their personality tags explicitly, so the call that sets the precedent has to bind them
too — otherwise the tags are the one part of a profile no rule ever pins to its language.

The appended sentence is carried over verbatim from the pre-``output_language`` INIT prompt rather than
newly worded, and the participant rule it extends is untouched, so the eight-arm measurement of that rule
still describes the judgement this text asks for. What the extra sentence does to tag-language consistency
is not itself measured — the corpus judges the profile's prose, not its labels.
