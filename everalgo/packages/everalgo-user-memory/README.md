# everalgo-user-memory

User-side memory products for EverAlgo — four LLM-backed extractors (`EpisodeExtractor`, `ForesightExtractor`, `AtomicFactExtractor`, `ProfileExtractor`), an `EpisodeReflector` that merges several episodes into one narrative, plus a `BoundaryDetector` class facade that wraps `everalgo-boundary`.

See the umbrella project: [EverAlgo monorepo](../../README.md) and the architecture document at [`docs/concepts/architecture.md`](../../docs/concepts/architecture.md).

## Install

```bash
pip install everalgo-user-memory
# Auto-pulls: everalgo-core, everalgo-boundary
```

## Quick start

All extractors are stateless classes; pass `llm=` at construction time. The `sender_id` argument is always required and is not inferred from the conversation.

```python
import asyncio
import json

from everalgo.llm.types import ChatResponse
from everalgo.testing.fake_llm import FakeLLMClient
from everalgo.types import ChatMessage, MemCell
from everalgo.user_memory import (
    BoundaryDetector,
    EpisodeExtractor,
    ForesightExtractor,
    AtomicFactExtractor,
    ProfileExtractor,
)

_BOUNDARY_JSON = json.dumps({"reasoning": "single topic", "boundaries": [], "should_wait": False})
_EPISODE_JSON  = json.dumps({"title": "Alice asks about async retries", "content": "Alice explored async retry patterns.", "summary": "Alice explored async retry patterns."})
_FORE_JSON     = json.dumps({"foresights": [{"content": "Alice will read the follow-up doc", "evidence": "assistant promised a doc", "start_time": "2023-11-14", "end_time": "2023-11-21", "duration_days": 7}]})
_FACT_JSON     = json.dumps({"atomic_facts": {"time": "Nov 14 2023", "atomic_fact": ["Alice is learning Python async."]}})
_PROFILE_JSON  = json.dumps({"explicit_info": [], "implicit_traits": [{"category": "Technical", "description": "Python developer."}]})


async def main() -> None:
    messages = [
        ChatMessage(id="m1", role="user",      content="I want to learn Python async retry patterns.", timestamp=1_700_000_000_000, sender_id="u_alice", sender_name="Alice"),
        ChatMessage(id="m2", role="assistant",  content="Sure — I'll send a follow-up doc next week.", timestamp=1_700_000_001_000, sender_id="assistant"),
    ]

    fake = FakeLLMClient(responses=[
        ChatResponse(content=_BOUNDARY_JSON, model="fake"),
        ChatResponse(content=_EPISODE_JSON,  model="fake"),
        ChatResponse(content=_FORE_JSON,     model="fake"),
        ChatResponse(content=_FACT_JSON,     model="fake"),
        ChatResponse(content=_PROFILE_JSON,  model="fake"),
    ])

    # Step 1: boundary detection → MemCell
    result = await BoundaryDetector(llm=fake).adetect(messages, is_final=True)
    mc = result.cells[0]

    # Step 2–4: user-memory extractors
    episode   = await EpisodeExtractor(llm=fake).aextract(mc, sender_id="u_alice")
    foresights = await ForesightExtractor(llm=fake).aextract(mc, sender_id="u_alice")
    facts      = await AtomicFactExtractor(llm=fake).aextract(mc, sender_id="u_alice")

    # Step 5: Profile takes a chronological Sequence[MemCell]; last is most recent
    profile = await ProfileExtractor(llm=fake).aextract([mc], sender_id="u_alice")

    print(episode.subject, profile.summary)


asyncio.run(main())
```

## Choosing the output language

Every LLM-backed method takes an `output_language`. Name one and the model writes in it; leave it out and the
model works the language out for itself, which is measurably less reliable:

```python
from everalgo.user_memory import EpisodeExtractor, OutputLanguage

# Caller decides. Zero wrong-language output over the regression corpus: seven languages, five models,
# every interference pattern it holds.
episode = await EpisodeExtractor(llm=client).aextract(
    mc, sender_id="u_alice", output_language=OutputLanguage.CHINESE
)

# Model decides. Roughly one extraction in nine comes back in the wrong language, and which cases fail
# depends on the model — one of the five measured never drifted, another drifted on a quarter of them.
episode = await EpisodeExtractor(llm=client).aextract(mc, sender_id="u_alice")
```

Plain strings work too, in any casing (`"chinese"`, `"German"`) — convenient when the value comes from
config. An unrecognised name raises `ValueError` rather than reaching the prompt.

**Decide the language once, upstream, and pass the same value to every call.** The alternative — deriving
one extractor's language from another's output — inherits that extractor's error rate, and for profiles the
consequence compounds: a profile updated without a named language inherits whatever language it already
says, so one wrong INIT persists through every later update. Passing the language on the update is the way
back out. Note also that `category` and `trait` labels are model-authored, so they follow the argument along
with the descriptions (`Location` versus `居住地`) — worth knowing if you group or filter on them.

What "leave it out" means depends on the operator. The four reading a raw conversation judge the language from
what the participants write, which is the 10.2% path above. The two reading already-extracted memory —
`AtomicFactExtractor.aextract_from_text` and `EpisodeReflector.areflect` — instead inherit the language of
their input, which is a much easier call for a single-language narrative but not free: `areflect` takes
*several* episodes at once, so episodes that disagree on language leave the model to pick one, and an
`areflect` update inherits whatever the existing narrative says. Name a language when the inputs may
disagree, or to move a narrative that is already in the wrong one.

## Customising prompts

Each extractor accepts a `prompt=` override per call, or the module-level constant can be monkey-patched at
startup for a global override:

```python
# Per-call override. A replacement keeping the {language_rule} placeholder keeps output-language control;
# one that drops it opts out.
episode = await EpisodeExtractor(llm=client).aextract(mc, sender_id="u_alice", prompt=my_custom_prompt)

# Global: replace the default prompt at startup
import everalgo.user_memory.prompts.en.foresight as _fs
_fs.FORESIGHT_GENERATION_PROMPT = my_custom_prompt
```

Prompts ship in English only. A parallel `prompts/zh/` tree used to carry translations and was removed:
prompt language turned out to dictate output language almost entirely, so the translations were an implicit
language switch maintained by hand. `output_language` does that job from one prompt tree, for languages
nobody has to translate a prompt into.

## API surface

```python
class BoundaryDetector:
    def __init__(self, *, llm: LLMClient) -> None: ...

    async def aextract(
        self, memcell: MemCell, *,

        prompt: str | None = None,
        custom_instructions: str | None = None,
        output_language: OutputLanguage | str | None = None,   # None → the model infers it
    ) -> Episode: ...

    async def aextract(
        self, memcell: MemCell, *,
        sender_id: str,
        prompt: str | None = None,
        output_language: OutputLanguage | str | None = None,   # None → the model infers it
    ) -> list[Foresight]: ...

class AtomicFactExtractor:
    def __init__(self, *, llm: LLMClient) -> None: ...
    async def aextract(
        self, memcell: MemCell, *,
        sender_id: str | None,           # None → generic facts not bound to any user
        prompt: str | None = None,
        output_language: OutputLanguage | str | None = None,   # None → the model infers it
    ) -> list[AtomicFact]: ...

    async def aextract_from_text(
        self, text: str, *,
        timestamp: int,                  # anchors relative dates the text mentions
        prompt: str | None = None,
        output_language: OutputLanguage | str | None = None,   # None → inherited from the input
    ) -> list[AtomicFact]: ...

class ProfileExtractor:
    def __init__(self, *, llm: LLMClient) -> None: ...
    async def aextract(
        self, memcells: Sequence[MemCell], *,
        sender_id: str,
        old_profile: Profile | None = None,   # None → INIT mode; present → UPDATE mode
        prompt: str | None = None,
        output_language: OutputLanguage | str | None = None,   # None → the model infers it
    ) -> Profile: ...

class EpisodeReflector:
    def __init__(self, *, llm: LLMClient) -> None: ...
    async def areflect(
        self, episodes: Sequence[Episode], *,
        old_episode: Episode | None = None,   # None → INIT merge; present → UPDATE
        prompt: str | None = None,
        output_language: OutputLanguage | str | None = None,   # None → inherited from the input
    ) -> Episode: ...
```

Every episode carries three model-written fields: `subject` (the title), `episode` (the full narrative) and
`summary` (a display preview of the narrative — faithful to it, readable without it, under 50 words). All
three are required; if the model omits `summary` or returns it blank, `aextract` raises rather than
substituting a value. Up to 0.4 the field was a blind `episode[:200]` slice, because the prompts never asked
for it — a truncation cut mid-word in English, and in Chinese a verbatim copy of most of the body.

`EpisodeReflector` produces the same three fields, so a merged episode has a preview of the merged narrative.

`EpisodeExtractor` has two modes: pass `sender_id=str` to extract a user-focused episode (uses `USER_EPISODE_GENERATION_PROMPT`); pass `sender_id=None` for a generic whole-memcell episode (uses `EPISODE_GENERATION_PROMPT`).

`ProfileExtractor` has two modes: `old_profile=None` triggers INIT extraction; passing an existing profile triggers UPDATE (LLM emits add/update/delete ops). When the merged profile exceeds an internal item count threshold a second compact LLM pass runs automatically — this is transparent to the caller.

All class methods have a sync bridge: `extractor.extract(...)` is `async_to_sync(aextract)` — only for non-event-loop callers (CLI scripts, plain unit tests).

## Testing

```python
from everalgo.testing import FakeLLMClient, assert_episode_shape

fake = FakeLLMClient(responses=[ChatResponse(content=_EPISODE_JSON, model="fake")])
episode = await EpisodeExtractor(llm=fake).aextract(mc, sender_id="u_alice")
assert_episode_shape(episode)
```
