"""Category-aware retrieval — soft, search-after, rolled-up-from-hits boost.

The category dimension is treated as a *precision* signal layered on top of a
two-stage ``base_retrieve`` → ``rerank_fn`` pipeline. The design is deliberately
modest:

1. After recall, estimate a category mass distribution ``p(c)`` from the top
   recall hits, weighted by their recall ``Candidate.score`` (not by count, so
   a few strong hits dominate a long tail of weak ones).
2. Compute ``conf = p.top1 - p.top2`` — a confidence proxy. When the query is
   ambiguous or spans multiple categories, ``p`` is flat and ``conf`` collapses
   toward zero, automatically muting the boost.
3. Rerank the recall pool with the caller's ``rerank_fn`` (e.g. a cross-encoder).
4. Combine ``final = norm_rel + λ·conf·p(category_of(t))`` and resort.

Category never gates recall: misclassified or unclassified hits stay in the
pool. The boost is a tiebreaker, not a filter — this is the price of avoiding
"router selected the wrong shard" failure modes at the cost of a few percent
NDCG gain over pure cross-encoder rerank.

**Timing invariant.** ``rollup_category_mass`` MUST be called *before*
``rerank_fn``, because ``rerank_fn`` overwrites ``Candidate.score`` with the
relevance score and the mass needs the recall score. ``apply_category_boost``
runs on the rerank output. The ``acategory_retrieve`` facade enforces this
ordering.

The primitives ``rollup_category_mass`` and ``apply_category_boost`` are
pure-compute and exposed so callers that want a learning-to-rank reformulation
(treating category affinity as one feature among many) can compose them
without going through the facade.
