"""Cluster-scoped retriever composer for ``aagentic_retrieve``.

``acluster_retrieve`` scans the base retrieval results in score order and accumulates
distinct clusters until ``cluster_top_k`` are reached (first-hit strategy), then
expands those clusters' full memberships from a caller-provided ``all_docs`` list and
returns the expansion unreranked. Rerank is intentionally left to the caller
(typically ``aagentic_retrieve`` rerunning the same ``rerank_fn`` over Round 1 and
again over the merged Round 1 + Round 2 set), which avoids the double-rerank trap and
keeps the Round 2 final rerank effective.

    """Narrow full-corpus retrieve to top-K cluster scope and return the raw expansion.

    Algorithm:
        1. ``base_retrieve(query, base_candidates)`` — wide candidate pool for cluster
           selection (Level 1). Caller typically passes a hybrid (dense+sparse RRF)
           closure.
        2. Scan results in score order, accumulating distinct clusters (first-hit): the
           first member of a cluster seen determines that cluster's inclusion. Stop as
           soon as ``cluster_top_k`` distinct clusters are reached.
        3. Expand the selected clusters' full memberships from ``all_docs`` (id lookup)
           and return in ``all_docs`` order (no rerank, no truncation).

    Args:
        query: Search query.
        base_retrieve: Async ``(query, k) -> list[Candidate]`` used to seed cluster
            selection. Caller typically passes a hybrid (dense+sparse RRF) closure.
        base_candidates: Top-k passed to ``base_retrieve``. ``None`` means no
            truncation (passes ``len(all_docs)`` — the corpus upper bound). When set,
            typically 50-100; must be wide enough to cover ≥ ``cluster_top_k`` distinct
            clusters.
        clusters: All clusters in the corpus. Each cluster contributes its members at
            most once; the algorithm reads ``c.id`` and ``c.members``.
        all_docs: Full corpus snapshot as ``Candidate`` list. Used to expand selected
            clusters' members — items not in any selected cluster are dropped. Caller
            owns this list (small per-conversation corpus; OK to pass as plain list).
        cluster_top_k: How many top-scoring clusters to keep.

    Returns:
        Expanded members of the top-``cluster_top_k`` clusters, in ``all_docs`` order,
        unranked and unscored (each candidate's ``score`` is whatever ``all_docs``
        carried — caller should not rely on it). Empty list when no base hit maps to
        any cluster.

    Resource contract:
        - ``base_retrieve`` is called exactly once.
        - No rerank calls.
        - No LLM calls.
