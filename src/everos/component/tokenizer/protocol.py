"""Tokenizer protocol.

App-layer tokenisation gates every BM25-indexed field in LanceDB:
the source surface form lives
in ``<field>`` while the space-joined token stream lives in
``<field>_tokens``, and the FTS index reads only the latter using a
whitespace tokenizer. Keeping the tokenizer decision in the app layer
means it can swap (jieba → unigram → hf) without re-indexing or
touching LanceDB schemas.

The protocol is sync — every concrete tokenizer in scope today (jieba,
char-bigram, regex word-split) is CPU-bound with no IO, so an async
wrapper would just shuffle work onto the event loop. If a future GPU
or remote tokenizer needs IO it should add an async method explicitly.
