"""Jieba-based tokenizer — covers CJK + English mixed content.

Uses ``jieba.cut_for_search`` (search-mode segmentation: yields both the
greedy max-match segment and its finer sub-segments for compound CJK
words). Same mode as the legacy enterprise keyword-search path uses on
the query side — keeping cascade write and search query symmetric is
the hard contract for BM25 recall to work.

After segmentation we drop:

* whitespace / empty tokens (so the join-on-space output stays clean),
* tokens shorter than ``min_token_length`` (default 2 — same threshold
  enterprise's ``filter_stopwords(min_length=2)`` uses; single-char
  fragments mostly hurt BM25 precision),
* tokens in a small bilingual stopword set (Chinese function words +
  English articles / prepositions / aux verbs).
