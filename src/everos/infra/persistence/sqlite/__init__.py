"""SQLite business persistence layer.

Sits on top of :mod:`everos.core.persistence.sqlite` (engine + sessions +
``BaseTable`` + ``RepoBase``) and provides:

    * lazy process-wide engine + session-factory singletons
      (:mod:`.sqlite_manager`)
    * concrete table schemas under :mod:`.tables`
    * concrete repository singletons under :mod:`.repos`

External usage::

    from everos.infra.persistence.sqlite import (
        get_engine, get_session_factory, dispose_engine,
        # business tables / repos are re-exported here too —
        # callers MUST go through this top-level package because
        # ``infra.persistence.sqlite.**`` (sub-packages) are forbidden
        # to ``service`` / ``memory`` / ``entrypoints`` by import-linter.
        UnprocessedBuffer, Memcell, ConversationStatus,
        KnowledgeDocumentRow, KnowledgeTopicRow,
        unprocessed_buffer_repo, memcell_repo, conversation_status_repo,
        knowledge_document_repo, knowledge_topic_sqlite_repo,
    )

The :class:`SqliteLifespanProvider` runs ``SQLModel.metadata.create_all``
on app startup and ``dispose_engine`` on shutdown, so business code does
not need to manage either.
"""

# Importing ``tables`` registers every business SQLModel in
# ``SQLModel.metadata`` so ``SqliteLifespanProvider.startup`` can
# ``create_all`` without callers having to import each model module.
