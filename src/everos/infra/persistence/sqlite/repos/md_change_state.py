"""Repository for ``md_change_state`` — cascade work queue.

Sole writer of the table. The worker, watcher, scanner, and CLI all
go through this repo so the state-machine invariants (``processing``
claim semantics, retryable flag lifecycle) live in one place.

LSN ordering is **best-effort**, not strictly monotonic across
concurrent writers: :meth:`upsert` derives ``lsn = MAX(lsn) + 1``
which is a classic read-modify-write that two parallel writers could
race on (BEGIN DEFERRED leaves the SELECT half unprotected; cross-
process this is even more visible). The table schema does **not**
declare ``lsn UNIQUE`` and no caller depends on strict monotonicity —
the worker uses ``ORDER BY lsn LIMIT N`` for fairness only, and a
collision merely reorders two rows by a few ms; both rows are still
processed and the next upsert bumps the counter past the duplicate.
If a future feature needs strict monotonicity (e.g. CDC / audit log),
revisit by giving ``upsert`` its own ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` transaction.

Status values:

- ``pending`` — visible to the worker.
- ``processing`` — internal claim state (one worker is on it).
- ``done`` — handler succeeded.
- ``failed`` — handler exhausted retries or hit unrecoverable error
  (see ``retryable`` for the eligibility flag).

share this single source of truth so their notions of "same file" stay

        - **Existing row** → bump ``last_changed_at``, refresh
          ``kind`` / ``change_type`` / ``mtime``, reset status back to
          ``pending``, clear ``error`` / ``retryable``, and assign a
          fresh ``MAX(lsn) + 1`` so the worker re-processes this path
          *after* anything queued in between. ``retry_count`` is
          conditionally preserved: if the row was ``failed`` and the
          mtime is unchanged (scanner auto-retry), ``retry_count``
          carries over so the worker can enforce a total retry budget;
          otherwise it resets to 0 (new content deserves a fresh start).

        The fresh LSN on re-enqueue is the property that lets the worker
        rely on ``ORDER BY lsn`` for ordering without losing fairness
        when a file flickers in and out of the queue. The ``MAX(lsn)+1``
        derivation is best-effort under concurrent writers — see module
        docstring for the trade-off.
