"""Business SQLModel table schemas.

Each business table lives in its own module here (e.g. ``memcell.py``,
``unprocessed_buffer.py``). The package ``__init__`` re-exports them so
``SQLModel.metadata.create_all`` (run by
:class:`everos.core.lifespan.SqliteLifespanProvider` at startup) sees
every registered table.
