"""Common LanceDB base for everos tables.

:class:`BaseLanceTable` adds ``created_at`` / ``updated_at`` columns and
the :attr:`BM25_FIELDS` declaration + :meth:`ensure_fts_indexes`
classmethod so each schema owns *both* its column shape **and** its
BM25 index spec — repos stay focused on queries.

Note:
    LanceDB has no SQL ``onupdate`` equivalent — the application must
    explicitly set ``updated_at = get_utc_now()`` before calling
    :meth:`AsyncTable.update` / :meth:`AsyncTable.merge_insert`. The
    convenience :func:`touch` helper does this in one call.

    **Every datetime column automatically carries ``tz=UTC`` in the
    Arrow schema.** LanceDB's Pydantic→PyArrow converter does not
    understand ``typing.Annotated`` metadata, so :data:`UtcDatetime`
    cannot be used as the field type annotation. Instead,
    :meth:`BaseLanceTable.to_arrow_schema` walks the inferred schema
    and rewrites every ``timestamp[us]`` (naive) column to
    ``timestamp[us, tz=UTC]``. PyArrow then auto-``astimezone(UTC)``
    aware inputs on write **and** returns aware UTC datetimes on read
    — no per-table configuration, no caller-side ``ensure_utc``.

    Subclasses just declare ``datetime`` fields normally::

        Zero per-table configuration. The rewrite also **overrides any
        non-UTC tz** a subclass might have declared explicitly, because
        project convention is: storage is always UTC. Mixed-tz columns

        Idempotent: columns that already have an index are skipped, so
        this is safe to call on every startup.

        ``replace=True`` rebuilds each column's index in place instead of
        skipping it — used by :meth:`LanceRepoBase.rebuild_indexes`, which
        needs a fresh index but must never leave the column *without* one.
        Dropping first would do that, and a BM25 query in that window does not
        degrade — it raises ``Cannot perform full text search unless an
        INVERTED index has been created`` (measured; vector search does fall
        back to a flat scan, FTS does not). Since the recall legs are gathered
        without ``return_exceptions``, that window turns into a 500 on the
        whole search request. ``create_index(replace=True)`` is atomic: 49
        concurrent queries across 3 replaces saw 0 failures, and it collapses
        the live fragment set exactly as drop+create does (7 index files back
        to 4, measured).

        The FTS config is fixed
        to the app-layer pre-tokenisation + LanceDB normalisation
        convention (designed for **multilingual mixed content**):

        - ``base_tokenizer="whitespace"`` — split on the spaces our
          app-layer tokenizer provider already inserted between tokens.
        - ``lower_case=True`` — Unicode-aware case-fold (English A→a;
          no-op on CJK characters).
        - ``stem=True`` — Porter / Snowball English stemmer per
          ``language="English"`` (tantivy default). CJK tokens have no
          stemmer and pass through untouched.
        - ``remove_stop_words=False`` — **stop-word removal is owned by
          the app-layer** (:class:`JiebaTokenizer`), which already drops
          both Chinese and English stop-words before tokens reach the
          FTS index. Keeping FTS-side filtering off avoids double-
          filtering and a divided source of truth.
        - ``ascii_folding=True`` — strips diacritics (é→e) on Latin
          characters; no-op on CJK.
        - ``with_position=False`` — everos does OR-mode BM25 recall
          (``MatchQuery`` clauses; see ``search.recall.base.build_or_query``),
          never phrase queries, so token positions are never read.
          Building the position posting List is therefore pure overhead
          **and** triggers a ``Max offset exceeds length of values``
          offset-overflow crash inside lance's compaction once the
          position lists grow large (upstream lance-format/lance#7653).
          That crash blocks ``optimize()`` — including version cleanup —
          so the index dir grows unbounded until the disk fills. Keeping
          positions off avoids both the overhead and the crash.

        Subclasses normally do not need to override this — declaring
        :attr:`BM25_FIELDS` is enough.
