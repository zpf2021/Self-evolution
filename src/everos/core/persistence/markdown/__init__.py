"""Markdown file IO toolkit.

Atomic write + YAML frontmatter parse/dump + entry marker parse +
audit-form structured-entry parsing. Knows nothing about business
models (no MemCell / Episode); the :class:`Entry` here is a
*marker-delimited* span within a markdown body, not a business record.

External usage (IO + parse):
    from everos.core.persistence.markdown import (
        Entry, EntryId, StructuredEntry,
        MarkdownReader, MarkdownWriter, ParsedMarkdown,
        parse_frontmatter, dump_frontmatter,
        split_entries, find_entry,
        parse_structured_entry, render_structured_entry,
    )

External usage (frontmatter schema chassis):
    from everos.core.persistence.markdown import (
        BaseFrontmatter, UserScopedFrontmatter, AgentScopedFrontmatter,
        DailyLogPathMixin, SkillPathMixin, ProfilePathMixin,
        KnowledgeScopedMixin, KnowledgeDocumentPathMixin,
        KnowledgeTopicPathMixin,
    )

External usage (path safety):
    from everos.core.persistence.markdown import sanitize_dirname
