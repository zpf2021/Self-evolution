"""Frontmatter — YAML block parse / dump + L1 schema chassis.

Frontmatter is the leading ``---``-delimited YAML block at the top of
a markdown document::

    ---
    title: Hello
    tags: [a, b]
    ---
    # Body starts here

Two complementary surfaces live here:

1. :func:`parse_frontmatter` / :func:`dump_frontmatter` — schema-free
   YAML helpers (``yaml.safe_load`` / ``yaml.safe_dump``,
   ``sort_keys=False`` so caller-controlled key order is preserved).

2. The L1 chassis classes — :class:`BaseFrontmatter`,
   :class:`UserScopedFrontmatter`, :class:`AgentScopedFrontmatter` —
   which fix the *absolute-readonly* fields (``id`` / ``type`` /
   ``schema_version``) plus scope (``user_id`` / ``agent_id`` +
   ``track``). Every business frontmatter schema in
   ``infra/persistence/markdown/mds/`` subclasses one of these.

Concrete business schemas (``UserMemcellDailyFrontmatter``,
``SkillFrontmatter``, …) live in ``infra``; they add per-record
business fields plus the path-resolution metadata daily-log writers
need (``ENTRY_ID_PREFIX`` / ``DIR_NAME`` / ``FILE_PREFIX``).

        The single sanitization point for a skill's ``name`` value itself —
        as opposed to :meth:`skill_dir_name`, which additionally prefixes
        it for the directory segment. Callers building
        ``AgentSkillFrontmatter.name`` from LLM output (see
        ``memory.strategies.extract_agent_skill._persist_skill``) route
        through this *before* constructing the frontmatter, so
        ``frontmatter.name`` ends up byte-identical to the directory-derived
        name rather than merely idempotent-if-resanitized.

        This is lossy: distinct raw names can collapse onto the same
        sanitized name. Dropped punctuation, space/underscore collapse, and
        the 50-character cap are the visible cases (``"fix django"`` and
        ``"fix_django"`` both become ``"fix_django"``; ``"fix!django"`` and
        ``"fixdjango"`` both become ``"fixdjango"``). The larger case is
        every combining mark: a combining mark alone is not ``\\w``, so it
        is stripped regardless of script, and two names that differ only in
        their marks collide — e.g. Devanagari ``"किताब"`` and ``"कताब"``
        both sanitize to ``"कतब"``; the same holds for Thai tone marks,
        Hebrew niqqud, and Arabic harakat.

        Case is *not* folded, which makes the collision above
        filesystem-dependent rather than universal, and is the dimension an
        LLM varies most freely: ``"Fix Django"`` → ``"Fix_Django"`` and
        ``"fix django"`` → ``"fix_django"`` are two distinct sanitized
        names, so they are two rows in LanceDB (a case-sensitive Python
        string key) but one directory on a case-insensitive filesystem —
        macOS APFS and Windows NTFS in their default configurations. That
        splits the invariant this seam otherwise maintains: the surviving
        ``SKILL.md`` carries one of the two names in its frontmatter while
        the index still advertises both, so a search hit on the shadowed
        name resolves to the other skill's content. On a case-sensitive
        filesystem the same pair simply stays two independent skills.

        Because ``AgentSkillWriter.write_main`` is a full-file replace and
        the LanceDB primary key is ``f"{agent_id}_{sanitized_name}"``, a
        collision means the later skill silently overwrites the earlier
        one — its accumulated ``source_case_ids``, ``maturity_score``, and
        body are lost, not merged.

        This is deliberate, not an oversight — but not because a collision
        "usually reads as an intended update". ``_persist_skill`` sanitizes
        *before* constructing the frontmatter, so the LLM is shown the
        already-sanitized name in ``existing_relevant_skills``; when it
        then emits a raw name like ``"fix django"`` after having just been
        shown ``"fix_django"``, it has affirmatively treated them as two
        different skills, and the write silently merges them anyway.

        What justifies accepting it is narrower: the two alternatives are
        both worse here. Detecting a collision and raising would
        reintroduce the dead-letter DoS this sanitizer was built to avoid —
        LLM output would again decide whether a run survives. Appending a
        disambiguating suffix is the real candidate and is left for a
        deliberate design pass, not dismissed: it does *not* break the
        ``frontmatter.name`` ≡ directory-suffix identity (writing
        ``"fix_django_2"`` into both keeps that intact), but it does need a
        collision probe on a path that currently touches no other skill,
        and a rule for the case-insensitive-filesystem variant above where
        the probe must compare case-folded while the key stays exact.
