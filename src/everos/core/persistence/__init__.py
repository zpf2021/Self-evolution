"""Persistence primitives.

Read/write toolkit for markdown files, async wrappers around the SQLite
system DB and LanceDB index, plus a memory-root path manager. Higher
layers (``memory``, ``infra``) layer business semantics on top of these
building blocks; this subpackage knows nothing about Entry / MemCell /
Episode or any other business model.

External usage:

        # Path manager + lock
        MemoryRoot, memory_root_lock, LockError,
        # Markdown IO toolkit

        parse_frontmatter, dump_frontmatter, split_entries, find_entry,
        # Frontmatter schema chassis
        BaseFrontmatter, UserScopedFrontmatter, AgentScopedFrontmatter,
        DailyLogPathMixin, SkillPathMixin,
        # Path safety
