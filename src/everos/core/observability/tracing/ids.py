    """Generate a request id matching the W3C trace-context spec.

    Returns 32 lowercase hex characters (128-bit, no prefix) — the same
    format as a W3C ``trace_id`` / OpenTelemetry trace identifier. Routes
    and services that mint a fresh request id (when one wasn't injected
    by upstream middleware) should call this helper rather than rolling
    their own uuid / prefix format, so the id layer stays compatible
    with OpenTelemetry exporters and standard APM tooling.

    Example::

        >>> rid = gen_request_id()
        >>> len(rid)
        32
