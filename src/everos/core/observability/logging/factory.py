"""structlog logger factory.

Provides ``get_logger(__name__)`` for module-level logger acquisition.
``configure_logging()`` is called once at process startup (run.py / lifespan)
to set up the structlog processor chain and route stdlib logging through
the same formatter so output stays uniform regardless of the caller.

The configuration follows structlog's official "Foreign Log Integration"
recipe: a single ``ProcessorFormatter`` renders both everos's own
``get_logger(...)`` calls and any stdlib ``logging.getLogger(...)`` call
made by third-party libraries (uvicorn, fastapi, httpx, openai, ...).
That way all three of the previously divergent prefixes — ``INFO:``,
``[warning  ]``, plus the unconfigured no-prefix output — collapse to
one ``[level] event key=value`` shape.

Rust-side loggers (LanceDB / Lance / Arrow) live in the Rust ``log``
crate and emit straight to stderr without going through Python; this
module cannot reach them. Control their level with ``RUST_LOG`` env.

    After this call:

    * Every ``structlog.get_logger(...)`` and ``logging.getLogger(...)``
      message flows through the same ``ProcessorFormatter``, so output
      format is identical regardless of which logging API the caller used.
    * Root-logger handlers are replaced with a single ``StreamHandler``
      pointing at ``sys.stdout``; any previously installed handler
      (uvicorn's default ``LOGGING_CONFIG``, libraries that call
      ``logging.basicConfig``, etc.) is removed.

    The ``uvicorn.run(..., log_config=None)`` flag is the matching half
    on the server entry point — without it, uvicorn re-installs its own
    handlers on every startup and overrides what we set here.
