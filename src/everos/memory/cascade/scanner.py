"""Periodic md tree scanner.

The watcher catches realtime events but misses:

- files created while the daemon was down,
- ``cp`` / external editors that move-replace and confuse inotify,
- WSL2 / network mounts where fsevents don't propagate.

The scanner closes those gaps by walking the memory root every
``scan_interval`` seconds (default 30s, configurable later), matching
paths against the kind registry, reading prior state, and running the
pure :func:`reconcile` function to emit the upsert plan.

Walking happens off the event loop via ``asyncio.to_thread`` since
``pathlib.Path.rglob`` is sync; the prior-state fetch + upsert calls
stay async on the loop.

    """Walk ``root`` once per registered kind, returning every match.

    ``kinds`` — when non-``None`` — restricts the walk to specs whose
    ``name`` appears in the set; other kinds' md files are neither
    stat'd nor emitted. Used by kind-scoped sync callers (e.g. Phase-3
    backfill) so their sweep doesn't touch queue state for unrelated
    kinds. The paired state-snapshot filter lives in :meth:`scan_once`
    (reconcile itself is kind-agnostic) — both sides must be scoped or
    reconcile would emit spurious ``deleted`` decisions for rows the
    scan simply chose not to look at.

    ``stat()`` failure mode discrimination is **load-bearing**: the
    reconciler treats "in state but not in scan" as a deletion signal,
    so if we silently drop a path here under a *transient* OS error,
    the next reconcile sweep will emit ``change_type='deleted'`` for
    that healthy md and the handler will wipe its LanceDB rows.

    Two errno classes:

    - :class:`FileNotFoundError` (ENOENT) — the file was unlinked
      between ``glob`` and ``stat``. This is a genuine deletion; drop
      from inputs so the reconciler emits ``deleted`` (correct).
    - any other :class:`OSError` (EMFILE / ENFILE — FD exhaustion,
      EACCES — perms, EIO — disk error, etc.) — we don't know whether
      the file is gone. **Raise** to abort the whole sweep; the
      ``_run_loop`` outer ``try / except Exception`` catches and logs
      it, and we retry on the next interval. A partial scan is worse
      than no scan, because the reconciler can't tell the difference.

    Symptom this guards against (observed 2026-05-28 on LoCoMo
    benchmark conv_2): a search-time FD exhaustion bled into the
    concurrent scanner sweep, and 8 healthy md files got marked
    ``change_type=deleted, status=done`` with their LanceDB rows
    cleared — single-direction data loss until external intervention.
