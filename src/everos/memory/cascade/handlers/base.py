"""Handler chassis — abstract base + shared :class:`HandlerDeps`.

Each kind has its own concrete handler responsible for translating a
single md path's content (or absence) into the corresponding LanceDB
row state. The handler is the *only* cascade-side piece that knows
the per-kind row shape; everything around it (watcher / scanner /
worker / orchestrator / CLI) is kind-agnostic.

Per-kind handlers share the same dependencies bundle — tokenizer,
memory-root path resolver — packaged as :class:`HandlerDeps`.
Construct it once at orchestrator startup, pass to every handler
factory, no per-row resolution churn. Embedding is a soft dependency:
handlers fetch it themselves via
:func:`everos.component.embedding.get_embedding_capability` rather
than receiving it here.
